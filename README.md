Fossilium Helper

This app (a single HTML file) helps keep track of Victory Points, Guests and Regulars for the board game Fossilium, as the physical version has very fiddly bits. It also automates the "Opening Phase" in the game. To install, just copy the file fossi.html on your device and open it in a browser.
